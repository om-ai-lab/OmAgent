<Instruction> The following two lists represent an unsorted list of numbers and a sorted variant of that list. The sorted variant is not correct. Fix the sorted variant so that it is correct.
Make sure that the output list is sorted in ascending order, has the same number of elements as the input list ({{length}}), and contains the same elements as the input list. </Instruction>

<Approach>
To fix the incorrectly sorted list follow these steps:
1. For each number from 0 to 9, compare the frequency of that number in the incorrectly sorted list to the frequency of that number in the input list.
2. Iterate through the incorrectly sorted list and add or remove numbers as needed to make the frequency of each number in the incorrectly sorted list match the frequency of that number in the input list.
</Approach>

<Examples>
Input: [3, 7, 0, 2, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 7, 8, 5, 5, 3, 9]
Incorrectly Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Reason: The incorrectly sorted list contains four extra 0s, two extra 4s and three extra 9s and is missing two 2s.
Output: [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]

Input: [6, 4, 5, 7, 5, 6, 9, 7, 6, 9, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1, 9, 2, 4, 9, 0, 7, 6, 5, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 1]
Incorrectly Sorted: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Reason: The incorrectly sorted list contains two extra 4s and is missing two 6s and one 9.
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 4, 9, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 4, 9, 1, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 5, 6, 3, 8, 6, 7, 5, 8, 5, 0, 6, 3, 7, 0, 5, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 4, 9, 0, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7, 7, 2, 1, 3, 9, 9, 7, 9, 6, 6, 4, 5, 4, 2, 0, 8, 9, 0, 2, 2]
Incorrectly Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Reason: The incorrectly sorted list contains one extra 8 and is missing two 2s, one 3, three 4s, two 5s, one 6, six 7s and one 9.
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
