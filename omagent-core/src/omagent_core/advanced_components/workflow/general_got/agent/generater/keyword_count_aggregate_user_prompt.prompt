<Instruction> Combine the following 2 dictionaries, each containing the frequency of countries in a text, into a single dictionary.
Simply add the frequencies together for each country and if a country is not present in one of the dictionaries, add it to the final dictionary with the frequency from the other dictionary.
Only output the final merged dictionary without any additional text or thoughts! </Instruction>
