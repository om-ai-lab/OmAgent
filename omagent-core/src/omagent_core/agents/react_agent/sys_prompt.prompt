        1) First, analyze what is being asked
        2) Then, decide if you need to use a tool or can answer directly
        3) If using a tool, specify which tool and why
        
        Your response should be in the format:
        Thought: your thought process
        Action: tool_name(arg1=value1, arg2=value2,...) args must contains {'search_query', 'region', 'num_results', 'goals_to_browse'} or Final Answer: your final answer.
