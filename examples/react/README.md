# ReAct Example

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a paradigm that combines reasoning and acting in an interleaved manner. The agent uses reasoning to determine what actions to take and interprets the results of those actions to inform further reasoning.

This example demonstrates how to use the framework for ReAct tasks. The example code can be found in the `examples/react_example` directory.

```bash
cd examples/react_example
```

## Overview

This example implements a ReAct workflow that consists of following components:

1. **Input Interface**
   - Handles user input containing questions
   - Supports both CLI and programmatic interfaces

2. **ReAct Workflow**
   - Think: Reason about the current state and decide next action
   - Act: Execute the chosen action (e.g., web search)
   - Observe: Process the results of the action
   - Repeat until the task is complete or max steps reached

### The workflow follows this pattern:

1. User provides input (question)
2. Agent thinks about the question and decides to take an action (e.g., search)
3. Agent observes the result
4. Process repeats until the answer is found

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Required packages installed (see requirements.txt)
- Access to OpenAI API or compatible endpoint (see configs/llms/*.yml)
- Redis server running locally or remotely
- Conductor server running locally or remotely

## Configuration

The container.yaml file manages dependencies and settings for different components of the system. To set up your configuration:

1. Configure your container.yaml:
   - Set Redis connection settings for both `redis_stream_client` and `redis_stm_client`
   - Update the Conductor server URL under conductor_config section
   - Adjust any other component settings as needed

2. Configure your LLM settings in configs:
   ```bash
   export custom_openai_key="your_openai_api_key"
   export custom_openai_endpoint="your_openai_endpoint"
   ```

## Running the Example

You can run the example in three ways:

1. Using the CLI interface:
   ```bash
   python run_cli.py
   ```

2. Using the programmatic interface:
   ```bash
   python run_programmatic.py
   ```

3. Running batch testing with dataset:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_test.py [options]
   ```
   This script will:
   - Read questions from the input dataset
   - Process each question using the ReAct workflow
   - Save the results in a standardized format
   - Output results to `data/{dataset_name}_{alg}_{model_id}_results.json`

   Available options:
   ```bash
   --input_file     Input dataset file path (relative to project root)
                    Default: data/hotpot_dev_select_500_data_test_0107.jsonl
   
   --dataset_name   Name of the dataset
                    Default: hotpot
   
   --model_id       Model identifier
                    Default: gpt-3.5-turbo
   
   --alg           Algorithm name
                    Default: ReAct
   
   --output_dir    Output directory for results (relative to project root)
                    Default: data
   ```

   Example usage:
   ```bash
   python run_batch_test.py \
       --input_file data/custom_test.jsonl \
       --dataset_name custom \
       --model_id gpt-4 \
       --alg ReAct-v2 \
       --output_dir results
   ```

When running the CLI or programmatic interface, you'll be prompted to:
1. Input an example (optional, press Enter to skip)
2. Set maximum turns (optional, default is 10)
3. Input your question

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Verify Redis is running and accessible
- Check your OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Review logs for any error messages
- Check the proxy settings if needed

Common issues:
- Connection errors: Check your network settings
- LLM errors: Verify your API key and endpoint
- Redis errors: Ensure Redis server is running

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of using the ReAct agent:

```bash
$ python run_cli.py

Please input your question:
The time when the first computer was inventedï¼Ÿ

[Agent starts reasoning and searching...]
```

The agent will then:
1. Think about how to answer the question
2. Search for relevant information
3. Process the search results
4. Provide a final answer based on the found information
